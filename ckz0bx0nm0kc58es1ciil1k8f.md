## How to Google like a Pro ðŸ˜Ž. #10Tips

## Introduction
Everything is available on the internet and google is a platform to search through them. Well, everyone knows that ... *duhh*. But how many of us know how to use google search **efficiently**? Very few actually. **Googling is an art**. To get the right answers, you need to ask the right questions, but to get the right answers quickly, you must know **how** to ask the right questions. Everyone should learn the **how** part, and that's what this blog is all about. Below are some of the great tips and tricks you can use to find correct answers to your questions effectively and efficiently.

### 1. Using quotes to get the "EXACT" match
Generally, when we do a normal search on Google, it makes a **shallow** search which may result in pages that **may or may not contain** all the words you mentioned in the search query. But if you wrap your search query/ question (either a term or a phrase) within quotes i.e. `"your question goes here"` then Google will do a deep search and all the results **will include** pages that **contain all the terms** in your question that you put within quotes. This is helpful when you absolutely want a particular term/ phrase to be there in your search results

### 2. Search within a specific site with `site:`
If you want Google to return results from within a particular website, just add `site:` before the question you are searching. This is also helpful when you want to search for something within a website which do not have an internal search option or perhaps have a bad one. For e.g. searching for ***site:freecodecamp.org react*** will populate search results only from [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) website on the topic of React.

### 3. Excluding a term from search results with `-`
If you don't want a term or phrase to appear in your search result, then just add `-` in front of that word. For e.g. a search on => ***how to write components in React -class*** will return all the search results that will not have the term "class" in them. Thus (if you know a bit of React) giving you only ways how to write functional components in React.

### 4. Search images of a particular size with `imagesize:`
If you want to search images of a particular size then use the tag `imagesize:` in your search query along with the width and height in **pixels**. Dimension should be in **pixels** only for e.g. `imagesize:500x500` will populate image results which have a dimension of 500px x 500px

### 5. Searching for a particular filetype with `filetype:`
If you want to get search results that contain a particular file type such as PDF or PPT etc, then add `filetype:<extension>` (without the angular brackets). For eg: ***react tutorial filetype:pdf*** will generate the following results

### 6. Use wildcard `*` to make searches
If you are unsure about or have forgotten any term in your search query/ question, then use the wildcard `*`, and Google will replace it for you with relevant terms. For e.g. a search on => the * of money will populate the following results

### 7. Combining searches with `OR`, `AND` logic
If you want your search results to contain two terms then put the `AND` keyword in between them. For e.g. the search on => ***React AND Angular*** will fetch results that have both the terms react and angular in it. Similarly, if you want either of the terms in your search results then use the `OR` keyword in between them. For e.g. the search on => ***React OR Angular*** will fetch results that have either of the terms or even both.

### 8. Filter out searches with `AFTER:`, `BEFORE:` or `..` between two numbers
If you want Google to populate search results that were published after a particular year then use the tag `AFTER:`. For e.g. the search on => ***React tutorials AFTER:2020*** will populate search results published after 2020. Similarly adding a tag `BEFORE:` will return results published before a particular year. You can also search for results published between a certain year range or for that matter between any number. Just add `..` between the two numbers you want to search between along with the units if any.

### 9. Check out related websites using `related:`
If you want to know what all other websites are available on the internet which is similar to a particular website, then use the `related:` tag. For e.g. a search on ***related:google.com*** will fetch all the websites that are similar to Google like Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo etc.

### 10. To see Google's cached version of a website
Google stores a cached version of websites to provide search results quickly. To see if google has cached any site or not just use the tag `cache:` in front of the website's URL. This is especially helpful to **web developers** to check if they are currently viewing a cached site or the latest version of a website after they have pushed some changes on the website. For e.g. a search for => ***cache:www.sohamderoy.dev*** on the day of writing this blog i.e. 30th Jan 2022 returns the following result.

It is important to note that "Not all search operators return exhaustive results." as mentioned by [Google](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?visit_id=637790664879774647-1036329470&p=adv_pages_similar&hl=en&rd=1) itself. Still, I believe that these are some really handy tips that help a lot to make an effective and efficient Google search. I hope I was able to explain them properly and have encouraged you to use them in your regular Google search.
